# Color-Flipper-JS-project
It's cool writing this project, as it establish my knowledge of some of the javascript theories that i have learnt.
With this project, i was able to learn how to declare a function, 
How to add click events,
Working with Math.random to generate random numbers,
Working with Math.florr to round intergers,
Working with loops to initiate number of occurence.
It was so exciting and lovely doing this.
